Kernel-side scripts
===================

These scripts are used for the host-side of my kernel building and
distribution. They help in building the kernels, modules and devicetrees
used for my bootfarm and also in patch maintenance.

They currently expect to be dumped into a __maintainer-scripts subdir
below the kernel source directory.


Build-scripts
-------------

build_full.sh: full build of arm32 and arm64 and bootfarm triggering
build_localimages.sh: build local images from build-result, used for
                      actually usable devices not part of the bootfarm

build_arm32.sh: arm32-specific subset of build_full.sh. Allows one parameter,
                a defconfig to build; defaults to oldconfig
build_arm64.sh: arm64-specific subset of build_full.sh. Allows one parameter,
                a defconfig to build; defaults to oldconfig
build_dtbs.sh: only build and distribute new devicetree files

build_clean.sh: cleanup build directories


For-Next scripts
----------------

Help in maintaining my for-next branch.
I use kernel-version-specific branches, i.e. v4.9-armsoc/dts32 etc, so

create_for-next.sh: one parameter, the version-prefix i.e. v4.9. Merges all
                    matching branches not named *shared* into an existing
                    for-next branch.

recreate_for-next.sh: recreates the for-next branch. Takes two parameters.
                      First is the version-prefix explained above and second
                      is the offset to start from, like v4.3-rc1 and defaults
                      to simply "master".
