Bootfarm-side scripts
=====================

These scripts are expected to sit on the bootfarm serverboard
in a static directory /home/devel/hstuebner/bootfarm currently.


power-board.sh:
    Script to abstract handling of all the different power-state
    methods (ykush, fritzdect, servo, etc). Reads board data from
    /home/devel/nfs/instances which now also contains infos on how
    its power-handling is done.

rebuild-initramfs.sh:
    Script to create an initramfs matching the rootfs with newly
    installed modules. Chroots into the rootfs and calls
    update-initramfs for the new kernel version.
    May require a separate NOPASSWD sudoers entry to run non-
    interactively.

rebuild-netboot.sh:
    Core script to rebuild all the netboot images and distribute
    modules to the rootfs instances. rootfs instances are described
    in a file /home/devel/nfs/instances as NAME:ARCH pairs with ARCH
    being either arm32 or arm64 currently and the rootfs directories
    being named /home/devel/nfs/rootfs-NAME.

refresh-chroots.sh:
    Uses parts of the Debian pbuilder code to open the rootfs
    instances as chroots and refresh the packages in them.
    Expects qemu-user-static to be installed and everything
    hooked into binfmt already, so that even non-native
    architectures can do that.
